# bank-app 
Hello!
This is a small program I craeted that mirros a banking app or atm. By using classes objects and functions the program displays a menu with options such as "withdraw" and "deposit". It then asks the user for the amount they would like to withdraw/deposit. It updates the balance of the account and keeps asking the user what they would like to do next until the user exits the program.
